===================================

The **project** represents a classic Web-Queue-Worker architecture (Microsoft, 2021). 
The core components of this architecture are a web front end that serves client requests, and a worker that performs resource-intensive tasks, long-running workflows, or batch jobs. The client communicates with the worker through message queues via the web front end.
